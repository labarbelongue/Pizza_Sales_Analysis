# Pizza Sales Analysis 


# Project Overview 

I analyzed this pizza sales dataset I found on Kaggle to showcase my Data Analysis skills.

At the beginning, I imported the csv files on SQL Server to see what the dataset we have looks like.

After I got familiar with it, I decided on which KPIs I was going to work with and calculated them using basic and intermediate queries. 

Then I wanted to see the KPIs in relation to the parameters I picked such as date, time, category, size and best/worst performing products.




After I was done with SQL, I moved on to create a Power BI dashboard in order too get better insights.

I imported the files to Power BI from the database I had created on SQL Server. Luckily I didn't have to do too much data modeling as it was already separated into 4 csv files.

First, I extracted month and day names from the date column, and the hours from the time column via Power Query to be able to demonstrate the busiest and most profitable months, days and hours.

As a second step, I created a measure table to store the KPIs I created using DAX formulas.

The rest was only dragging and dropping. 

Finally, I created my page navigators/filters/bookmarks and made sure that everything looked good.

The source files, queries and Power BI project can be seen in this repository.
